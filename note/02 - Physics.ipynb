That sounds presumptuous, and you'd be quite right, but at some point, you're at a point where you understand all the things that we have discussed so far, and yet this theoretical approach seems so novel. Why is that? Because the typical pedagogical explanations do not give you the full story. Once you are ready, by which I mean, once you have a good intuitive understanding, you are ready to walk to the cliff. The formulas and derivations explained in these theoretical texts are essentially all we -humans, that is- have figured out about electromagnetism. Once you understand this approach, in some way, you have mastered the subject fully. It is quite an investment to get to the cliff, with little or no practical payoffs, but the reward is in the journey, and the overview you acquire in the end is the cherry on top. I guess this is where the roads of physics and engineering really deviate.\n",
